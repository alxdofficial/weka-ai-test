# Fashion design classification algorithm


this software has 3 fashion design/season models built in, when a user inputs various parameters about a garment, the software can return a guess of which design-season it belongs to.
this software uses a naive bayes machine learning model and looks at parameters such as clothing length, lines, fabric material, and etc.

this software is dedicated to a friend of mine who is looking to improve her style but has not enough time shopping. but this software can be easily generalized to include more design-seasons to suit more users. this is also a chance for me to learn about machine learning so thats why im doing it.
